About the Stats, now it only contains the combat stats, should we also include XP, Level and Rank (S, A, B, etc) to Stats?

For me, I used CombatStatsSO to contain data in different scenes.
To debug without resetting the SO everytime, just tick the "Debug" checkbox on every CombatEntityAdventurer, so they will not write data to SO, but only read.
