  description: 'Before us lies the impregnable Fortress of Doldrey. No army has breached
    its walls in over 100 years. His Majesty has been throwing his men at it for
    the better part of this campaign and progress has been made.


    He gives the
    charge to the Band of the Hawk - we must not falter.'
  completionText: Astounding! No other living man can claim to the glory we have
    achieved today. For this, there will be endless praise and rewards unlike any
    we have seen before.
